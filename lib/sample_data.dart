    'text': 'I was flying through candy clouds, soaring above a landscape made of chocolate rivers and towering candy canes. The air smelled sweet, and every breath felt like tasting cotton candy. As I zoomed through the sky, I spotted jellybean birds chirping tunes and gummy bears cheering from below. Suddenly, a licorice dragon appeared, breathing out swirls of caramel mist.

I sprinted down the slope, dodging trees made of graham crackers and boulders that crumbled into cookie crumbs. The marshmallow gained speed, and I barely managed to dive into a chocolate river before it crashed down.
